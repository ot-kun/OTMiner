# OTMiner
ESP32 miner with sha256 Hardware Acceleration

## Caution
ESP32 is a powerful device, however it is no way or extremely low possibility to actual mine a BTC Block in terms of lightyear. "To infinity and beyond!"

## Introduction
no fancy UI, just a hash unit. Keep it simple and easy scale up. Or just a OLED Display is more than enough. I would like to know if some mining units keep sending nice share or no share at all. I need all the data, so a scaling up is needed.

## Configurations
Configurations through Serial the first time.
`WIFI SSID`
`WIFI PASSWORD`
`POOL URL` (without stratrum+tcp)
`POOL PORT`
`ADDRESS`

## Todos
- ETHernet instead of WiFi (keep power consumption at mininal)
- 32 ESP C6 mining units on a single PCB
- 96 ESP C6 mining units on a single PCB
